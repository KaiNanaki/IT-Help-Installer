# IT-Help-Installer
 A Powershell Script to automate the installing of the XPanel/Adobe AIR  software, copy the IIT Help Page files into their correct directory, and create a public desktop shortcut to be accessed by anyone logging on to the instructors PC. 
 The script needs to be accompanied by the Icon file/Installers in the XPanel folder, along with each room's XPanel folder (which should include its own XPanel file)  Eg. script on root E:\ and the files in E:\XPanels\*room names*
